Gamma Ctegorization

#Creational Patterns
- Deal with creation of objects
- Explict (constructor) v.s. implicit (Dependency Injection, Reflection, ect)
- wholesale (single statement) v.s. piecewise (step by step)

#Structual Patterns
- Concerned with the structure
- Many are wrappers to mimic the underlying class's interface
- Stress the importance of good API design

#Behavior Patterns
- no central theme
